### Describe possible performance optimizations you could make to your
code itself.
- Possible performance optimizations I could have done it's to use fragments instead of divs
- Understand better about data structure
- Use of memo, react memo and react usecallback to memoize items, so it doesn't need to be requested all the time when values are not changed.

### What could you have improved?
- For this especifict test, there's no much what can be improved. But for big projects, We can add some global state managements like redux or contextApi for a better management of functions and states. For example, when we request all posts, we can do it just once and save the response to a global state and call this state everytime we need.
- I could have improved the UI for better user experience
- Data structure to recive the post and three more posts.
